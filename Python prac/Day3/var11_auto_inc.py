#If environment is "production", replicas must be at least 3 and debug mode must be False.
#If environment is "staging", set replicas to 2 and allow debug mode to stay as-is.
#In "dev", replicas stay 1, but debug mode should always be True.
#If the region is "us-east" and environment is "production", print an extra message:
